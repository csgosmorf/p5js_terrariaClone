# p5js_terrariaClone
Incomplete clone attempt of terraria's terrain generation with ability to mine blocks by holding down mouse1 (trees take longer).
I would like to clean up the code sometime in the future.
I would also like to re-create this game in java or c++ some time in the future, because this would allow for better memory management and a more complete feel.

^^EDIT: I did re-create this game in java (https://github.com/csgosmorf/Java_Terraria), and it has a sprite and physics too. I may not return to this javascript version because my java version has surpassed this one in many ways.

Controls:
  1,2,3,4,5... for inventory slot select
  scrollUp/scrollDown for inventory slot select
  w,a,s,d to move (you are the black rectangle) //Thinking of adding physics instead of just floating
  mouse1 (HOLD) for mining a block, or a whole tree
  mouse2 to place a block
